# This hook runs AFTER the devcontainer files have been copied and user-specific
# env settings appended. If you have any user-specific initialization to perform this
# is the place for it

# This is also the hook you want to use to create resources required for this template
# to work - creating instances, attaching volumes, etc.

# !! Remember to destroy those resources in the appropriate *-deactivate hooks !!
